# MT5599-Project-FEniCS-code

Project abstract: Rho-GTPase proteins are important cytoskeleton regulators within many eukaryotic cells. They regulate the morphology of the cell to facilitate active diffusion in response to directional stimuli such as chemoattractant concentration. An understanding of the process underpinning the polarisation of two major forms of Rho-GTPases, active and inactive, within these cells can lead to new developments in the medical field such as the ability to control inflammation in the immune response. I investigated the current literature on this topic and attempted to recreate some of the key points of their analysis using FEniCS, a finite-element method based open-source computing platform. I used this to solve two simple models, Wave-Pinning and Turing-type, in order to compare their solutions when dealing with the same initial conditions. I have found that the Wave-Pinning model is more suitable for modelling the behaviour of neutrophil cell spatial polarisation in response to chemoattractant stimuli for cell migration.

The code in this repository allows for the reproduction of the results in my Masters Project
It uses FEniCS, a finite-element method based open-source computing platform. This code is structured using Python syntax and was run on a Windows subsystem for Linux using Ubuntu.
